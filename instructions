This a game based around solving weight based puzzels that involve
transporting the correct number of standardized weights to specific scale tiles which will weight them.
Each scale is set up to expect a precise amount of weight to be placed on it. If the correct amount of
weight is placed on all scales then the game is won. If any scale has the incorrect amount of weight
placed on it then the game ends in failure.The player may move one step in any directions (including diagonals). The player cannot
move outside of the environment.The game ends in failure when if the player steps on a scale carrying the wrong amount of
weight and also ends in failure if the player fails to drop a weight.The game ends in victory when all the scales are removed.
